# Stock-Exchange-Simulator
Project of Java application for stock exchange simulation for Object Programming university course.

Application allows user to define exchanges for raw materials, securities, currencies and simulate it's operation. Each exchange has it's own assets defined by user. User defines investors, companies and investment funds as well. Then he can simulate - investors generate transactions (comissioned and realised as in real life with daily sessions) affecting assets' prices. When simulation is paused, user can view, add, remove and edit stock-world objects or perform some actions on them.

The goal of the project was to learn object-oriented programming paradigm.
Moreover, project requirements covered: designing project UML diagram, including multithreading and synchhronization using monitors/semaphores, creating complete GUI with charts ploting, saving simulation state using serialization.
